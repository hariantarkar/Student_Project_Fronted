                The <b>Student Performance Prediction System</b> is an innovative web-based
                platform developed to forecast student academic outcomes using advanced{" "}
                <b>Linear Regression techniques</b>. By analyzing crucial factors such as study
                hours, attendance records, mock interview results, MCQ test scores, and internal
                assessments, the system provides an accurate prediction of a studentâ€™s final
